# R + Python Binder Example

This repo builds on the [r binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/r) and [jupyter lab binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab) and is complementary to the [multi-language-demo binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/multi-language-demo) with examples on using both R and python in both Jupyter Lab and RStudio.

 - Launch in Jupyter Lab: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sungjyoo/py4_statistics/main?urlpath=lab)
